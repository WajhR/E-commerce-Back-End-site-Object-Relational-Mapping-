# E-commerce-Back-End-site-Object-Relational-Mapping-
## Description

The back-end database has been purposed towards e-commerce websites using Express.js API and Sequelize to connect to the MySQL database. The back-end database allows users to create a development database, seed it with test data, and sync Sequelize models to MySQL database. User's have the ability to use GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE routes to display and manipulate data in the users database. Give it a try and see how it helps your company power up to the next level!
